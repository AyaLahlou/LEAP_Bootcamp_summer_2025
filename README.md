| Day   | Topic                                                       | Description                                                                                                         |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1 | Intro to Neural Networks and CNNs                           | Cover perceptrons, MLPs, convolutional layers and pooling; build a simple CNN to extract spatial features from climate maps. |
| Day 2 | Temporal Models: Recurrent Neural Networks & Attention      | Introduce RNNs, LSTMs and Transformers; implement sequence models to forecast time-series climate variables and visualize attention weights. |
| Day 3 | Unsupervised Pattern Discovery & Anomaly Detection          | Explore PCA/EOF for dominant modes, build autoencoders for dimensionality reduction and identify anomalies in gridded data. |
| Day 4 | Surrogates & Physics-Informed Models                        | Train neural network emulators for toy climate processes, then add physics-based penalties (e.g., conservation constraints) to improve realism. |
