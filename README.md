|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1  | Intro to Neural Networks and CNNs                           | Perceptrons, MLPs, convolutional layers; build a simple CNN to extract spatial features from climate maps. |
| Day 2  | Temporal Models: Recurrent Neural Networks & Attention      | RNNs, LSTMs and Transformers; implement sequence models to forecast time-series climate variables and visualize attention weights. |
| Day 3  | Unsupervised Pattern Discovery & Anomaly Detection          | PCA/EOF, autoencoders; GANs vs. VAEs |
| Day 4  | Surrogates & Physics-Informed Models                        | Train neural network emulators for toy climate processes, add physics-based penalties to improve realism. |
